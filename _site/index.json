AdlxDisplay – identity + per-feature getters/setters (gamma, gamut, 3DLUT, custom color, connectivity, resolutions, color depth, pixel format, FreeSync, VSR, integer scaling, GPU scaling, scaling mode, HDCP, VariBright, blanking, resolution). Profiles are JSON-serializable and skip unsupported features. AdlxDesktop – geometry/orientation, members, profile capture/apply. AdlxPerformanceMonitor, AdlxGpuTuning, AdlxMultimedia, AdlxPowerTuning, Adlx3DSettings – profile capture/apply + per-feature access; handle gating and skip on unsupported interfaces. Legacy helpers: Static helper classes (e.g., ADLXDisplayHelpers, ADLXDesktopHelpers, ADLXPerformanceMonitoringHelpers, ADLXGPUTuningHelpers, ADLXMultimediaHelpers, ADLXPowerTuningHelpers, ADLX3DSettingsHelpers) remain only for compatibility; prefer the facades. Samples/tests use facades exclusively. Regenerating bindings (optional) cd ADLXWrapper ClangSharpPInvokeGenerator @ClangSharpConfig.rsp Generated files land in cs_generated/ and are excluded from source control. Version gating and skips Prefer on-demand QueryInterface gating and propagate ADLX errors (e.g., ADLX_NOT_SUPPORTED/ADLX_BAD_VER) when features are unavailable. Display apply methods accept an optional skip callback to surface skipped features when newer interfaces are unavailable. Always guard test/sample runs with ADLXHardwareDetection.HasAMDGPU and ADLXApi.IsADLXDllAvailable to skip cleanly on non-AMD systems.

Logging Configure via ADLXApi.EnableLog(LogProfile) with destinations: local file, debug view, or managed sink (ADLX_LOG_DESTINATION + ADLX_LOG_SEVERITY). DisableLog() reverts to low-noise debug-view logging and disposes any managed sink. Testing and hardware notes Run from repo root: dotnet test ADLXWrapper.Tests/ADLXWrapper.Tests.csproj. Tests auto-skip on non-AMD systems or when amdadlx64.dll is unavailable; a fully passing run requires an AMD GPU with ADLX installed. Samples can be built with dotnet build Samples/ADLXWrapper.Samples.sln; runtime behavior that touches hardware requires AMD drivers."

    "title": "ADLXWrapper API Docs | ADLXWrapper",
    "summary": "ADLXWrapper API Docs Overview Facade-first C# bindings over ADLX with vtable interop; generated types live in ADLXWrapper/cs_generated and facades/RAII helpers in ADLXWrapper. Typical flow: initialize once, fetch system services, work through facades, dispose to terminate ADLX and unload the DLL. Profiles capture current state and apply it back safely; unsupported features are skipped rather than failing hard. Tests and samples are skip-safe on non-AMD systems or when amdadlx64.dll is missing. Initialization & Lifetime Prefer ADLXApi.Initialize() for standard bring-up; InitializeWithCallerAdl is available for ADL interop (see ADLXWrapper/ADLXApi.cs). Objects throw ObjectDisposedException after disposal; ADLXApi.Dispose terminates ADLX then unloads the DLL. Check availability before use: ADLXApi.IsADLXDllAvailable(out var reason) and ADLXHardwareDetection.HasAMDGPU (see ADLXWrapper/ADLXHardwareDetection.cs). Use GetSystemServicesProfile() to acquire the primary facade; raw handles remain available via Get...Handle() escape hatches. Facades & Entry Points System: ADLXSystemServices (enumerates displays/desktops; access to performance monitoring, GPU tuning, multimedia, power tuning, and 3D settings). Defined in ADLXWrapper/ADLXSystemServices.cs. Display: AdlxDisplay (identity, gamma/gamut/3DLUT, custom color, connectivity, resolutions, color depth, pixel format, FreeSync, VSR, integer scaling, GPU scaling, scaling mode, HDCP, VariBright, blanking, resolution). Profiles skip unsupported features. See ADLXWrapper/AdlxDisplay.cs. Desktop: AdlxDesktop (geometry/orientation, members, profile capture/apply). See ADLXWrapper/AdlxDesktop.cs. Performance monitoring: AdlxPerformanceMonitor (sampling config profile, current metrics, history, support). See ADLXWrapper/ADLXPerformanceMonitoringHelpers.cs. GPU tuning: AdlxGpuTuning (auto/preset/manual tuning profiles, per-feature apply). See ADLXWrapper/ADLXGpuTuningHelpers.cs. Multimedia: AdlxMultimedia (video upscale, video super resolution profiles). See ADLXWrapper/ADLXMultimediaHelpers.cs. Power tuning: AdlxPowerTuning (SmartShift Max/Eco, manual power/TDC where supported). See ADLXWrapper/ADLXPowerTuningHelpers.cs. 3D settings: Adlx3DSettings (Anti-Lag, Boost, RIS, Enhanced Sync, VSync, FRTC, AA/AF, Tessellation). See ADLXWrapper/ADLX3DSettingsHelpers.cs. Profiles & Apply Semantics Each facade exposes GetProfile() / ApplyProfile(profile); profiles are JSON-serializable DTOs (no unmanaged pointers). Apply is skip-safe: features missing or unsupported on the current interface are skipped; ADLX errors still raise ADLXException. Display apply accepts an optional skip callback to surface skipped features. Version gating is on-demand: attempts QueryInterface for newer interfaces; propagates ADLX_NOT_SUPPORTED / ADLX_BAD_VER as appropriate. Logging Configure via ADLXApi.EnableLog(LogProfile) with destinations: local file, debug view, or managed sink; disable via DisableLog() (see ADLXWrapper/ADLXApi.cs and ADLXWrapper/LogProfile.cs). Local file requires FilePath; application sink requires a managed sink delegate; debug view requires neither. Events Display events: obtain display-services handle from the facade, then register listeners through IADLXDisplayChangedHandling (pattern mirrored in ADLXWrapper/README.md). GPU tuning and multimedia change handling follow similar listener acquisition via their respective services. Build & Test Visual Studio 2026: open ADLXWrapper.sln, restore, build, and run tests in Test Explorer (tests skip on non-AMD or missing amdadlx64.dll). VS Code / dotnet CLI: ./prepare_adlx.ps1, ./build_adlx.ps1, optional dotnet build Samples/ADLXWrapper.Samples.sln, tests via dotnet test ADLXWrapper.Tests/ADLXWrapper.Tests.csproj. Samples & Skip Behavior Samples live under Samples and use facades exclusively; they are runtime skip-safe on non-AMD hardware or when the ADLX DLL is absent. Tests in ADLXWrapper.Tests auto-skip in the same conditions; a full pass requires an AMD GPU with ADLX installed."

    "summary": "\uFEFF## ADLXWrapper expansion plan Phase 1: Core Feature Implementation (Complete) [x] Display Settings (get/set): Implemented color depth/format, scaling, FreeSync, etc. [x] Desktop/Eyefinity: Implemented grid/layout reading, change handling, and create/destroy wrappers. [x] 3D Settings: Implemented full get/apply support for Anti-Lag, Boost, RIS, etc. [x] Event Handling: Added listeners for Display, Desktop, and GPU Tuning changes. [x] API Polish: Refactored into a clean, helper-based architecture. Phase 2: Next Steps [ ] Create comprehensive sample applications demonstrating save/load of full system state. [ ] Expand test coverage for Apply methods. [ ] Document advanced use cases like event handling. Phase 3: Interface version gating [x] Wire DisplayServices v1/v2 gating in helpers/facades (blanking via DS1; connectivity via DS2; retain DS3-only FSCA/DRRC). [x] Run regression tests after gating changes (current run skipped on non-AMD hardware; DLL missing on host). Phase 4: Facade expansion (Complete) [x] Stage 1 – Scope inventory: Catalog remaining non-facade helpers/raw entry points (GPU tuning, performance monitoring, multimedia, power tuning, 3D settings, logging/system init variants). Note call sites in samples/tests to quantify migration. Raw helper surfaces to replace with facades: ADLXGPUTuningHelpers (manual/preset/auto tuning, fan/VRAM/power tuning; event listeners stubbed), ADLXPowerTuningHelpers (SmartShift Max/Eco, manual power/TDC), ADLXPerformanceMonitoringHelpers (metrics support/current/history, sampling config), ADLXMultimediaHelpers (video upscale/VSR), ADLX3DSettingsHelpers (anti-lag/boost/RIS/ESync/VSync/FRTC/AA/AF/Tessellation). Legacy DTO helpers still present: ADLXGpuHelpers, ADLXDisplayHelpers, ADLXDesktopHelpers. System logging/init facade absent. Call sites using helpers: Samples (PerfMonitoringSample, MultimediaSample, PowerTuningSample) and tests (GpuTuningServicesTests, PerformanceMonitoringServicesTests, MultimediaServicesTests, PowerTuningServicesTests, ADLX3DSettingsTests, ResourceSafetyTests) rely on helpers + raw handles. [x] Stage 2 – Surface design: Define facade types and naming aligned with existing conventions (Profile naming, legacy handle escape hatches). Decide gating/error propagation per area (QueryInterface, ADLX_NOT_SUPPORTED/BAD_VER pass-through). GPU tuning: AdlxGpuTuning facade from ADLXSystemServices.GetGpuTuningProfile(AdlxInterfaceHandle gpu); profiles via GpuTuningProfile GetProfile() / ApplyProfile(GpuTuningProfile profile); feature-level profiles ManualFanProfile, ManualVramProfile, ManualGfxProfile, ManualPowerProfile, AutoTuningProfile, PresetTuningProfile; legacy escape hatch GetGpuTuningServicesHandle(). Gate via QueryInterface to v1/v2; skip unsupported, propagate ADLX errors when present interface fails. Performance monitoring: AdlxPerformanceMonitor from ADLXSystemServices.GetPerformanceMonitoringProfile(); config profile PerformanceMonitoringProfile (sampling interval, history size) with GetProfile/ApplyProfile; metric APIs GetGpuMetricsSupport, GetCurrentGpuMetrics, EnumerateGpuMetricsHistory, GetCurrentSystemMetrics, GetCurrentAllMetrics; handle escape GetPerformanceMonitoringServicesHandle(). Multimedia: AdlxMultimedia from ADLXSystemServices.GetMultimediaProfile(AdlxInterfaceHandle gpu); MultimediaProfile contains VideoUpscaleProfile and VideoSuperResolutionProfile; GetProfile/ApplyProfile; handle escape GetMultimediaServicesHandle(). Power tuning: AdlxPowerTuning from ADLXSystemServices.GetPowerTuningProfile(); SmartShiftProfile (Max/Eco) and per-GPU ManualPowerProfile (power/TDC) with GetProfile/ApplyProfile; QueryInterface to v1 for TDC/Eco; handle escape GetPowerTuningServicesHandle(). 3D settings: Adlx3DSettings from ADLXSystemServices.Get3DSettingsProfile(AdlxInterfaceHandle gpu); ThreeDSettingsProfile (AntiLag, Boost, RIS, EnhancedSync, WaitForVerticalRefresh, FrameRateTargetControl, AntiAliasing, AnisotropicFiltering, Tessellation) with GetProfile/ApplyProfile; handle escape Get3DSettingsServicesHandle(). Logging/init: add ADLXApi.EnableLog(LogProfile profile) and DisableLog() to wrap existing logging entry points; ensure consistency with DLL load/terminate lifecycle. DTOs: all profiles JSON-serializable; no unmanaged pointers; include support flags where relevant; apply methods skip unsupported features and can return/emit skip info later if needed. [x] Stage 3 – API shape draft: Sketch C# types and primary methods/properties per facade (profiles, support queries, apply patterns, JSON DTOs, ComPtr ownership rules). [x] Public facade entrypoints on ADLXSystemServices: GetGpuTuningServices(), GetPerformanceMonitoringServices(), GetMultimediaServices(), GetPowerTuningServices(), Get3DSettingsServices() returning facades; raw access via Get...ServicesHandle().

Escape: Get3DSettingsServicesHandle(). [x] Profile DTOs: JSON-serializable shapes with support flags; include per-feature support booleans/ranges; no unmanaged pointers. Apply methods skip unsupported; when interface exists but call fails, propagate ADLXException. GPU tuning profile captures auto/preset/manual (gfx/vram/fan/power), SmartShift (if present), with ranges where needed. Performance monitoring profile captures sampling interval/history size. Multimedia profile captures enabled + sharpness for upscale, enabled for VSR. Power tuning captures bias mode/value and Eco enabled; optional per-GPU manual power/TDC. 3D settings profile captures the existing info structs. [x] Ownership/lifetime rules: facades keep owner ADLXApi; AddRef on service/GPU pointers; Dispose releases; throw ObjectDisposedException on use-after-dispose or when owner disposed. [x] Gating: attempt QueryInterface for newer interfaces/versions; if unavailable, mark unsupported and skip during apply; keep handle escape hatches for advanced use. [x] Stage 4 – Implementation: Build facades per area (GPU tuning, perf monitoring, multimedia, power tuning, 3D settings, logging). Implement profile capture/apply with skip-on-unsupported semantics and RAII/disposal safety. [x] Add facades and system entrypoints for performance monitoring, GPU tuning, multimedia, power tuning, and 3D settings (handles + acquisition helpers). [x] Wire ADLXApi convenience accessors if desired and ensure disposal guards across new types. [x] Add manual power/TDC profile flow (GPU-level) if kept separate from power tuning facade. [x] Logging facade: [x] Add LogProfile DTO (destination, severity, file path, optional managed sink shim) and keep it JSON-serializable. [x] Add ADLXApi.EnableLog(LogProfile) and DisableLog wrappers (mirrored on ADLXSystemServices); guard disposal and propagate ADLXException. [x] Test/verification notes: file logging happy path, disable path, dispose guard; optional callback sink if ADLX invokes it on this host. [x] Stage 5 – Samples/tests: Update samples to facades; expand tests for new surfaces (support gating, profile round-trips, disposal guards). Ensure non-AMD skip logic remains intact. [x] Tests migration (complete): Perf/Multimedia/Power/GPU Tuning/3D settings/Resource safety tests now use facades and AdlxInterfaceHandle with skip guards; latest dotnet test clean (skipped due to missing ADLX DLL/AMD GPU on host). [x] Sample migrations: Perf/Multimedia/Power tuning samples now use facades (GetSystemServicesProfile, GetPerformanceMonitoringServices, GetMultimediaServices, GetPowerTuningServices), legacy helpers removed; display/color/event/desktop samples verified facade-only; dotnet build Samples/ADLXWrapper.Samples.sln succeeds on host (skip-safe runtime expected without AMD GPU/DLL). [ ] Stage 6 – Docs/verification: Refresh READMEs with new quick-starts; run dotnet build ADLXWrapper/ADLXWrapper.csproj and dotnet test ADLXWrapper.Tests/ADLXWrapper.Tests.csproj (skip-aware); ensure no generated file edits. Docs refreshed: root README and ADLXWrapper/README now describe facade-first usage, logging, and skip-safe behavior. Next actions: run the above build/test on hardware with AMD GPU and amdadlx64.dll present; adjust docs if needed after hardware validation. [ ] Stage 7 – Copilot/README alignment: Update .github/copilot-instructions.md and project READMEs to reflect current facade-first usage, logging API, and sample/test expectations. [x] Stage 8 – API docs: Produce detailed API documentation in APIDocs/ (facade-first surfaces, profiles, logging, init/lifetime, gating/skip semantics, sample/test expectations). Generate markdown with links to relevant source files and usage snippets. Current state snapshot (2025-12-14) Stage 5 samples/tests are migrated to facades; dotnet build Samples/ADLXWrapper.Samples.sln succeeds on this host. Latest dotnet test ADLXWrapper.Tests/ADLXWrapper.Tests.csproj run was clean-but-skipped due to missing AMD GPU and amdadlx64.dll on this machine. Next active work: Stage 6 docs/verification (run build/test on AMD-capable host and refresh READMEs) and Stage 7 Copilot/README alignment. Runtime expectation: samples/tests remain skip-safe on non-AMD systems; hardware-dependent behavior still unverified here. Future things to fix Auto-tuning profile apply: auto-tuning is captured in GpuTuningProfile but not applied because no apply helper exists in current helpers. Add apply support when ADLX helper coverage is expanded. Align profile support flags and skip semantics across facades: add per-feature support markers to GPU tuning/power/multimedia/3D profiles to match display/desktop style and skip unsupported apply steps. ApplyProfile parity: ensure new facades gate via QueryInterface, skip unsupported features, and throw only on ADLX errors (mirror display/desktop behavior). Manual power/TDC flow: design and implement GPU-level manual power/TDC profile handling (or decide to drop it) and document the choice. Legacy helpers: mark legacy helper classes (ADLXGpuTuningHelpers, ADLXPerformanceMonitoringHelpers, ADLXMultimediaHelpers, ADLXPowerTuningHelpers, ADLX3DSettingsHelpers) as obsolete or retire them after migration to facades. Display/Desktop facade & profile plan Remove/replace legacy DTOs: DisplayInfo, DesktopInfo, and their enumeration helpers will be removed or marked obsolete; callers should migrate to facades/profiles. Files to update: ADLXDisplayHelpers.cs, ADLXDesktopHelpers.cs, samples, tests. Public API names (lock-in): ADLXApi.GetSystemServices() → ADLXSystemServices ADLXSystemServices.EnumerateAllDisplays() → IReadOnlyList<AdlxDisplay> ADLXSystemServices.EnumerateAllDesktops() → IReadOnlyList<AdlxDesktop> ADLXSystemServices.ApplyDisplayProfile(DisplayProfile) / ApplyDesktopProfile(DesktopProfile) AdlxDisplay: identity properties, per-feature getters/setters, GetProfile(), ApplyProfile(DisplayProfile), GetDesktop() (lazy resolve) AdlxDesktop: geometry/orientation, GetDisplays(), GetProfile(), ApplyProfile(DesktopProfile) Feature coverage to capture/apply in profiles (no pointers, JSON-ready): gamma, gamut, 3DLUT, custom color, connectivity, custom resolutions, color depth, pixel format, FreeSync, VSR, integer scaling, GPU scaling, scaling mode, HDCP, VariBright, blanking, resolution (native/current). Omit others only if unsupported by ADLX APIs. Lazy desktop resolution: AdlxDisplay.GetDesktop() enumerates desktops via desktop services, traverses member displays, matches by UniqueId; cache result, refresh if stale. Interface versioning: acquire v1 services, attempt cast to v2/v3 for newer features; if cast fails, mark feature unsupported and skip. Only throw when interface exists but ADLX returns an error. Lifecycle/disposal: facades own ComPtrs, track parent ADLXApi disposal; throw ObjectDisposedException on use-after-dispose. Profiles JSON contract: Newtonsoft.Json; profiles contain identity (UniqueId, GpuUniqueId, Name, optional EDID) + per-feature state structs; no unmanaged pointers. System-level apply: ApplyDisplayProfile/ApplyDesktopProfile resolve live objects by UniqueId, apply supported features, skip unsupported ones; consider returning per-feature results or logging skips. Tests/samples: migrate DTO-based samples/tests to facades/profiles; add save/load/apply tests and version-fallback coverage. Backward compatibility: decide whether to [Obsolete] legacy helpers or remove; current plan favors removal to reduce confusion. Detailed implementation blueprint (for a human programmer) Public types and methods (names are final): ADLXApi ADLXSystemServices GetSystemServices() ADLXSystemServices IReadOnlyList<AdlxDisplay> EnumerateAllDisplays() — returns live facades, owns ComPtr copies. IReadOnlyList<AdlxDesktop> EnumerateAllDesktops() — returns live facades, owns ComPtr copies. void ApplyDisplayProfile(DisplayProfile profile) — resolves display by UniqueId, applies supported features, skips unsupported. void ApplyDesktopProfile(DesktopProfile profile) — resolves desktop, applies desktop geometry/orientation if applicable, then applies member display profiles by UniqueId. AdlxDisplay (fields: ComPtr<IADLXDisplay> _display; ComPtr<IADLXDisplayServices> _services; ADLXApi _owner; AdlxDesktop? _cachedDesktop) Identity properties: string Name, int Width, int Height, double RefreshRate, uint ManufacturerId, uint PixelClock, ADLX_DISPLAY_TYPE Type, ADLX_DISPLAY_CONNECTOR_TYPE ConnectorType, ADLX_DISPLAY_SCAN_TYPE ScanType, ulong UniqueId, int GpuUniqueId, string? Edid. Profile: DisplayProfile GetProfile(), string ToJson(), void ApplyProfile(DisplayProfile profile). Desktop linkage: AdlxDesktop GetDesktop() — lazy resolve via desktop services: enumerate desktops, traverse displays, match UniqueId, cache result; re-resolve if cached is disposed. Per-feature getters/setters (all check support, throw ADLXException on ADLX failures; return tuples or state structs): GetGamma/SetGamma(GammaState), GetGamut/SetGamut(GamutState), GetThreeDLUT/SetThreeDLUT(ThreeDLUTState), GetCustomColor/SetCustomColor(CustomColorState), GetConnectivity/SetConnectivity(ConnectivityState), GetCustomResolution/SetCustomResolution(CustomResolutionState), GetColorDepth/SetColorDepth(ColorDepthState), GetPixelFormat/SetPixelFormat(PixelFormatState), GetFreeSyncState()/SetFreeSyncEnabled(bool), GetVsrState()/SetVsrEnabled(bool), GetIntegerScalingState()/SetIntegerScalingEnabled(bool), GetGpuScalingState()/SetGpuScalingEnabled(bool), GetScalingMode()/SetScalingMode(ADLX_SCALE_MODE), GetHdcpState()/SetHdcpEnabled(bool), GetVariBright()/SetVariBright(VariBrightState), GetBlanking()/SetBlanked(bool), GetResolution()/SetResolution(DisplayResolutionState) where feasible. Disposal: implements IDisposable; throws ObjectDisposedException if used after dispose or after _owner disposed. AdlxDesktop (fields: ComPtr<IADLXDesktop> _desktop; ComPtr<IADLXDesktopServices> _desktopServices; ComPtr<IADLXDisplayServices> _displayServices; ADLXApi _owner) Properties: ADLX_DESKTOP_TYPE Type, int Width, int Height, int TopLeftX, int TopLeftY, ADLX_ORIENTATION Orientation. Composition: IReadOnlyList<AdlxDisplay> GetDisplays() — constructs displays with back-reference to this desktop. Profile: DesktopProfile GetProfile(), string ToJson(), void ApplyProfile(DesktopProfile profile) — rebind member displays by UniqueId and call their ApplyProfile. Disposal: implements IDisposable; same object-lifetime rules as display. Profile DTOs (Newtonsoft.Json, no unmanaged pointers): DesktopProfile ADLX_DESKTOP_TYPE Type, int Width, int Height, int TopLeftX, int TopLeftY, ADLX_ORIENTATION Orientation. List<DisplayProfile> Displays — member display profiles. DisplayProfile Identity: ulong UniqueId, int GpuUniqueId, string Name, string? Edid. Optional: DisplayResolutionState Resolution (current/native captured). Feature states: GammaState, GamutState, ThreeDLUTState, CustomColorState, ConnectivityState, CustomResolutionState, ColorDepthState, PixelFormatState, FreeSyncState, VirtualSuperResolutionState, IntegerScalingState, GPUScalingState, ScalingModeState, HdcpState, VariBrightState, BlankingState. State structs (all serializable): GammaState: preset enum (sRGB/BT709/PQ/PQ2084/G36/CustomCoeff/CustomRamp/Reset), optional ADLX_RegammaCoeff? Coeff, optional ADLX_GammaRamp? Ramp, bool Supported. GamutState: ADLX_GAMUT_SPACE? ColorSpace, ADLX_WHITE_POINT? WhitePoint, optional custom white ADLX_RGB?, bool Supported. ThreeDLUTState: ThreeDLUTMode Mode (Disabled/VividGaming), int? DynamicContrast, support flags. CustomColorState: int Hue, int Saturation, int Brightness, int Contrast, int Temperature, per-property support flags. ConnectivityState: bool? HdmiQualityDetectionEnabled, ADLX_DP_LINK_RATE? DpLinkRate, int? RelativePreEmphasis, int? RelativeVoltageSwing, support flags. CustomResolutionState: List<DisplayResolutionState> Resolutions, bool Supported. DisplayResolutionState: int Width, int Height, int RefreshRate. ColorDepthState: ADLX_COLOR_DEPTH? Value, bool Supported. PixelFormatState: ADLX_PIXEL_FORMAT? Value, bool Supported. FreeSyncState: bool? Enabled, bool Supported. VirtualSuperResolutionState: bool? Enabled, bool Supported. IntegerScalingState: bool? Enabled, bool Supported. GPUScalingState: bool? Enabled, bool Supported. ScalingModeState: ADLX_SCALE_MODE? Mode, bool Supported. HdcpState: bool? Enabled, bool Supported. VariBrightState: bool? Enabled, VariBrightMode Mode, bool Supported. BlankingState: bool? Blanked, bool Supported. Lazy desktop resolution algorithm (AdlxDisplay.GetDesktop()): enumerate desktops via desktop services; for each desktop enumerate displays; compare UniqueId; if match, return an AdlxDesktop facade; cache for future; if cache is disposed, re-resolve. Interface versioning pattern: always acquire base IADLXDisplayServices; try cast to v2/v3 where needed (FreeSync color accuracy, DRR, etc.). If cast fails, mark feature unsupported and skip during profile apply; setters throw only when the required interface is present but ADLX returns an error. Error/validation rules: use support queries/ranges before set; skip unsupported fields in ApplyProfile; log/collect per-feature skips (optional return structure) — decide minimal behavior (skip silently vs. optional callback/log). Lifecycle: facades own ComPtrs; disposing a facade releases the handle; using after dispose or after owning ADLXApi disposal throws ObjectDisposedException. Migration steps: Remove or obsolete DisplayInfo/DesktopInfo and related enumeration methods in ADLXDisplayHelpers.cs and ADLXDesktopHelpers.cs. Refactor samples to use AdlxDisplay/AdlxDesktop and profiles (GetProfile()/ApplyProfile/ToJson). Update tests to cover: enumeration returns facades, save/load/apply profile, unsupported feature skip, lazy desktop resolution, disposal guards, version fallback. Backward compatibility decision: default stance is removal of legacy DTO helpers to avoid dual APIs; if kept, mark [Obsolete] and document they do not support settings apply."
