# ADLXWrapper API Docs

Welcome to the generated API reference for **ADLXWrapper**, a C# façade over the AMD ADLX SDK. Use this site to explore the public classes, helpers, and DTOs that make up the wrapper. 

The goal of ADLXWrapper project is to provide a lightweight, simpler way to access the AMD ADLX API, to read settings and make changes to the AMD GPU settings. The ADLXWrapper project provides Helper objects that provide a pointer-free, simple ergonomic API surface to make suse easy, and it still exposies the native handles if you need to do something advanced.
