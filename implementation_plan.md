# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Update the ADLX_CSHARP_WRAPPER_GUIDE.md file to accurately reflect the current project structure, build processes, and available batch files, then update README.md to provide proper navigation links to all documentation files in the repository.

The current documentation contains outdated information about DLL names, .NET versions, and build processes. Additionally, the README.md lacks proper links to the comprehensive documentation available in the repository. This implementation will create accurate, comprehensive documentation that reflects the actual project structure and provides clear guidance for users.

## Types
No new type definitions required for this documentation update task.

This is purely a documentation update that will not modify any code structures, interfaces, or data types. All existing types and interfaces will remain unchanged.

## Files
Update existing documentation files to provide accurate and comprehensive information.

**Files to be modified:**
- `ADLX_CSHARP_WRAPPER_GUIDE.md` - Complete rewrite to reflect actual project structure, correct DLL names, accurate .NET version support, and comprehensive batch file documentation
- `README.md` - Add navigation links to all .md files, batch file reference section, and improved getting started instructions

**Files referenced but not modified:**
- `ADLX_GAMMA_RAMP_JSON_GUIDE.md` - Will be linked from updated README.md
- All batch files (7 total) - Will be documented in the updated guide
- Project files - Will be accurately referenced in documentation

## Functions
No function modifications required for this documentation update task.

This implementation focuses solely on updating documentation content. No code functions, methods, or procedures will be modified, added, or removed.

## Classes
No class modifications required for this documentation update task.

All existing classes and their documentation will remain unchanged. The updated documentation will accurately reference existing classes and their usage patterns.

## Dependencies
No dependency modifications required for this documentation update task.

The documentation updates will accurately reflect existing dependencies including Newtonsoft.Json, SWIG, Visual Studio requirements, and .NET Framework/.NET 8.0 support without changing any actual dependencies.

## Testing
Verify documentation accuracy through manual review and cross-referencing with actual project files.

**Validation approach:**
- Cross-reference all batch file descriptions with actual file contents
- Verify all file paths and names mentioned in documentation exist
- Ensure all .NET version references match actual project configurations
- Validate that all links in README.md point to existing files
- Review build instructions against actual project structure

## Implementation Order
Sequential documentation updates to ensure consistency and accuracy.

**Step 1:** Update ADLX_CSHARP_WRAPPER_GUIDE.md with comprehensive project information
- Correct project structure documentation
- Accurate DLL naming and build process information
- Complete batch file reference with descriptions
- Updated .NET version support information
- Corrected build instructions and examples

**Step 2:** Update README.md with navigation and reference information
- Add links to all documentation files
- Create batch file quick reference section
- Improve getting started instructions
- Add proper project overview and navigation structure
