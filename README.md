# ADLXWrapper
ADLX C# wrapper DLL and bindings for [ADLX](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/ADLX).
<br/><br/>
https://gpuopen.com/adlx/

# Prerequisites
You MUST install Swig v4 in order to generate the C# bindings that will let you access the functions in the DLL that you generate.
You can run the `install_swigwin.ps1` powershell script to download and install the windows version of swig. This will place it where the build scripts can get it and use it.

If you want to do things manually, you can download the windows version of [Swig from here](https://www.swig.org/download.html). Be sure to download the Swigwin ZIP file to the Solution directory, and unzip the ZIP file in the base SOlution Directory. Then rename the `swigwin-4.3.1` folder to just `swigwin`. Swig will now work with the build scripts. 

# How to use
The project is set up so that the following happens when you build the project:
- The pre-build powershell script downloads the latest version of the ADLX code from the AMD website. It also prepares the file structure for the build process to use.
- The main custom build process then runs. This generates the Bindings using [Swig](https://www.swig.org/download.html).
- The build then generates the ADLXWrapper.dll and the list of *.cs files in the Bindings directory. These are what you use in your application.

To use the ADLX C# wrapper DLL and bindings in an application, simply copy the ADLXWrapper.dll and the Bindings folder containing the many .cs files generated by this project into the project directory of your Application. You should then load the DLL as part of your application startup, and then import the Bindings files into your application. You can then use the ADLX C# wrapper by following [the AMD documentation](https://gpuopen.com/manuals/adlx/adlx-page_guide_init_help/#to-initialize-adlx-in-a-c-application) or by [examing the c# Samples](https://gpuopen.com/manuals/adlx/adlx-page_sample_cs/).
