# ADLXCBindings

ADLX C# wrapper DLL and bindings for [ADLX](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/ADLX).

The project is set up so that the following happens when you build the project:
- The pre-build powershell script downloads the latest version of the ADLX code from the AMD website. It also prepares the file structure for the build process to use.
- The main custom build process then runs. This generates the Bindings using [Swig](https://www.swig.org/download.html).
- The build then generates the ADLXCBindings.dll and the list of *.cs files in the Bindings directory. These are what you use in your application.

To use the ADLX C# wrapper DLL and bindings in an application, simply copy the ADLXCBindings.dll and the Bindings folder containing the many .cs files generated by this project into the project directory of your Application. You should then load the DLL as part of your application startup, and then import the Bindings files into your application. You can then use the ADLX C# wrapper by following [the AMD documentation](https://gpuopen.com/manuals/adlx/adlx-page_guide_init_help/#to-initialize-adlx-in-a-c-application) or by [examing the c# Samples](https://gpuopen.com/manuals/adlx/adlx-page_sample_cs/).
